Amazon is currently seeking enthusiastic interns who can work full-time for a minimum of 12-weeks between Fall 2015 and Summer 2016.  Our software engineers are the brains behind some of the industry's biggest breakthroughs. OS X, Siri, and iCloud - not to mention the system-level software for iPhone and Apple TV - all started here. This team is on the front line of Apple's constant charge toward innovation.   Frameworks provide internal Apple developers and our third-party developers with APIs and functionality that make Macs and iOS devices do more. Examples of popular frameworks include CoreLocation which uses a variety of sensors to pin-point your exact latitude and longitude, UIKit and AppKit which provide basic user interface elements to ensure a consistent customer experience, and the entire graphics stack which leverages the GPU and display to render elements on the screen.
