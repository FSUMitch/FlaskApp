If you are interested in being on the team that builds the world's fastest supercomputer, read on. Our team is designing how we integrate new HW and SW, validate extreme scale systems, and debug challenges that arise. The team consist of engineers who love to learn, love a good challenge, and aren't afraid of a changing environment. We need someone who can help us with creating and executing codes that will be used to validate and debug our system from first Si bring-up through at-scale deployment.
