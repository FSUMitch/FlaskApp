Apple is currently seeking enthusiastic interns who can work full-time for a minimum of 12-weeks between Fall 2015 and Summer 2016.  Our software engineers are the brains behind some of the industry’s biggest breakthroughs. OS X, Siri, and iCloud — not to mention the system-level software for iPhone and Apple TV — all started here. This team is on the front line of Apple’s constant charge toward innovation.   Back-end developers are responsible for making the features that our users love, like Siri, work by presenting data to the user-facing applications.
